<p class="gutsumm">[<span class="smcap">Literally Translated by a
Balliol First-Class Man</span>]</p>
<p class="gutsumm">[On a Proposal to place Bicycles within the
precincts of the Bodleian Library]</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Not concerning a thing of no moment, O Conscript
Fathers, you are now called upon to decide: whether to one man by
the counsel and advice of Curators it is to be permitted that he
should take away from you the power of placing in the Proscholium
the instruments of celerity, the assistances of (your) feet, the
machines appointed by a certain natural providence for the
performance of your duties: whether, in which place our ancestors
sold pigs with the greatest consent and indeed applause of the
Roman people, from that (place) bicycles are to be ejected by one
guardian of books.&nbsp; O singular impudence of the man!&nbsp;
For be unwilling, Conscript Fathers, be unwilling to believe <!--
page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>that in this pretence of consulting for (the interests
of) a public building something more is not also being aimed at
and sought to be obtained: in such a way (<i>lit.</i> so) he
attacks bicycles that in reality he endeavours to oppress the
liberty of each one of you: that by this example and as it were
by the thin end of a certain wedge he may lay the foundation of a
royal power over all these things, which I (as) consul
preserved.&nbsp; Concerning which matter I could say much, if
time allowed me: now behold and examine the miserable condition
of those whom a man devoid of constancy and gravity overturns
from (their) fortunes.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; What! shall the Masters of Arts, what! shall the
Doctors, what! shall the Proctors themselves (than which kind of
men nothing can exist more holy, nothing more upright, nothing
more auspiciously established) be compelled to come on foot that
they may consult those most sacred volumes in which the Roman
people have wished that all learning should be included?&nbsp;
The Hypobibliothecarii, what men! what citizens! will, I believe,
walk, especially considering that it is to be contended by them
against the lengthiness of a journey: and then, if, as (usually)
happens, some sudden tempest should arise, they must suffer <!--
page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>(their) bicycles lacking shelter to be most miserably
corrupted by rain.&nbsp; It has been handed down to memory,
Conscript Fathers, that Caius Duilius was permitted by the
republic, which he had saved by (his) incredible fortitude, to be
borne by an elephant whenever he had been invited to a
dinner.&nbsp; Therefore, did he use a most luxurious quadruped
that he might by so much the more quickly arrive at a banquet:
shall we, who desire to hasten not for the sake of lust and the
belly, but for the sake of this learning and books, be forbidden
to employ bicycles?&nbsp; I pray and entreat you, Conscript
Fathers, do not allow this disgrace to be branded upon the heart
itself and entrails of the commonwealth.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; But for(sooth) the College of All Souls (which I
name; for the sake of honour) is near, in which machines may be
sheltered.&nbsp; O thing before unheard (of)!&nbsp; From which
place even undergraduates have been excluded by a certain divine
will: into that shall bicycles be thrown?&nbsp; O times, O
manners!&nbsp; It is not fitting, Conscript Fathers, that the
studies of most learned men, Fellows, should be interrupted in
this way.&nbsp; Moreover, they also have a library, that to them
also it may be possible to say that wheels should be kept afar
<!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>off: they have keys, bolts, bars, a gate, a porter: they
will exclude, reject, expectorate them.&nbsp; Which act I blame
in such a way that I confess and acknowledge that it will be done
with the greatest legality.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; If the Founder of the Library, if Sir Thomas Bodley
himself, I say, should stand forth from the Elysian fields, it is
not necessary that I should remind you with what ancient severity
he would inveigh against this new power, against the
Bibliothecarius, nay rather, against the Curators themselves: for
you can calculate (it) in (your) minds.&nbsp; He would say to
them, &ldquo;Did I give you authority over books, that you should
use it against bicycles? did I place you in an upper part of a
most convenient building, that you should also rule the lower?
did I endow you with huge wealth and an enormousness of stipend,
that you should therefore the more exercise a kingly dominion
over the common utility, and the necks, heads, lives, fortunes of
the poorer citizens?&rdquo;&nbsp; To which interrogation and most
stern reproach I do not think they, although they are of a
remarkable audacity, could answer anything: for neither is there
(anything) that can be replied.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; Although I wish to say more things, I am <!-- page
5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>deterred
by the will of the editor of that most known Magazine (than which
paper I do not think that anything is more conjoined with the
safety of the republic): nor am I not also prevented by tears and
weeping itself.&nbsp; Conscript Fathers, if there is anything in
you of constancy, if of gravity, if of fortitude, if of humanity
(which that there is I most certainly know), fortify this common
citadel of the good: open the Pig Market, closed by the
intolerable influence of bad men: be unwilling, be unwilling that
the seat of the Muses, the School of Divinity, the most
delightful meeting-places of Boards of Faculties, should be
stained by royal power and polluted by cruelty.&nbsp; Which that
it will certainly happen if you do not prevent it by your votes,
I most confidently predict and vaticinate.</p>

6</span>THE EIGHTS IN FICTION</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Old Style</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that emphasizes the <i>amari
aliquid</i> of life like one&rsquo;s tobacconist,&rdquo; mused
Fane Trevyllyan as he flung a box of eighteenpenny Emeticos into
the fire and lit a Latakia cigarette.</p>
<p>It was a lovely August morning in the Eights of 18--; and the
stroke of the Charsley Hall boat reclined wearily in his
luxuriously furnished apartments within that venerable College
and watched the midday sun gilding the pinnacles of the
Martyr&rsquo;s Memorial.&nbsp; It had been a fast and furious
night, and Trevyllyan had lost more I.O.U.s than even he cared to
remember: and now he was very weary of it all.&nbsp; Had it not
been for one thing, he would have thrown it all up&mdash;sent
dons, deans, duns, and dice to the devil, and gone down by the
afternoon train: as it was, there was nothing for it but to
recline on his <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>tiger-skins and smoke countless
cigars.&nbsp; He never would train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to row to-day, Fane?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was little
Bagley Wood, the cox.&nbsp; Trevyllyan sanctioned his presence as
if he had been a cat or a lapdog: to all others he was stern and
unapproachable&mdash;a true representative of his Order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, <i>caro mio</i>,&rdquo; was the
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a bore, you know: and then I
half think I promised to take La Montmorenci of the Frivolity up
the Cherwell to Trumpington in the University Barge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! when the Lady Gwendolen de St. Emilion has come
down on purpose to see us catch Christ Church! why,
<i>sapristi</i>, where can your eyes be?&rdquo;&nbsp; The stroke
hissed something between his clenched teeth, and Bagley Wood
found himself flying through an unopened window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cherchez la femme</i>! it&rsquo;s always the way
with the Trevyllyans,&rdquo; muttered the lad, as he picked
himself up from the grass plot in the quadrangle and strolled off
to quiet his nerves with a glass of <i>aguardiente</i> at the
Mitre.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>An August moon shone brightly on the last night of the great
aquatic contest: the starter had fired his pistol, and all the
boats but one were off.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better think about starting,
Trevyllyan?&rdquo; asked the coach of the Charsley Hall Eight, a
trifle pale and anxious.&nbsp; &ldquo;See, they are all under
way.&nbsp; Glanville Ferrers, the Christ Church stroke, swears
you shan&rsquo;t bump him as you did last week.&nbsp; He must be
past the Soapworks by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>! then I suppose we ought to get
in,&rdquo; replied the other; and as he spoke he divested himself
of the academical garb that scarcely concealed his sky-blue
tights, and stood, a model of manly beauty, on the banks of the
rushing river.&nbsp; Then, throwing away a half-finished cigar,
Trevyllyan strode into the boat.&nbsp; <i>Per Bacco</i>!
&rsquo;twas a magnificent sight.&nbsp; As the crack Eight of the
river sped swiftly after her rival, cheers arose from the bank,
and odds on both boats were freely taken and offered by the
<i>cognoscenti</i>.</p>
<p>You and I, <i>amigo mio</i>! have seen many a race in our
day.&nbsp; We have seen the &rsquo;Varsity crews flash neck and
neck past Lillie Bridge: we have held our breath while Orme ran a
dead heat with Eclipse for the Grand National: we have read how
the victor of the <i>pancratium</i> panted to the <i>meta</i>
amid the Io Triumphes of Attica&rsquo;s vine-clad
Acropolis.&nbsp; But we did not see the great Christ Church and
Charsley&rsquo;s race&mdash;that great contest which is still the
talk of <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>many a learned lecture-room.&nbsp;
They say the pace was tremendous.&nbsp; Four men fainted in the
Christ Church boat, and Trevyllyan&rsquo;s crew repeatedly
entreated him to stop.&nbsp; But he held on, inexorable as the
Erinnyes.</p>
<p>Fair as Pallas Anadyomene&mdash;fair as the Venus whom Milo
fashioned <i>pour se d&eacute;sennuyer</i> in his exile at
Marseilles&mdash;the Lady Gwendolen de St. Emilion sat throned on
the University Barge, and watched the heroes as their bare arms
flashed in the moonlight.&nbsp; And now they were through the
Gut, and the nose of the Charsley&rsquo;s boat pressed hard on
its rival: yet Fane Trevyllyan did not make his final
effort.&nbsp; Would he spare Glanville Ferrers?&nbsp; <i>Quien
sabe</i>?&nbsp; They had been friends&mdash;once.&nbsp; But the
die was cast.&nbsp; As the boats sped past her the Lady Gwendolen
stooped from her pride of place and threw a rose&mdash;just
one&mdash;into the painted poop of the Christ Church
wherry.&nbsp; That was all: but it was enough.&nbsp; Trevyllyan
saw the action where he sat: one final, magnificent, unswerving
stroke&mdash;those who saw it thought it would never
end!&mdash;and with a muttered &ldquo;Habet!&rdquo; he sent the
brazen beak of his Eight crashing in among the shattered oars of
his helpless competitor.</p>

13</span>THUCYDIDES ON THE INFLUENZA</h2>
<p>Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of the epidemic
among the Oxonians, how they had the epidemic, having begun to
write as soon as it broke out on No. 2 Staircase, and considering
it to be the most noticeable of all that had appeared
previously.&nbsp; (For the place was not liable to diseases at
other times, but especially free from them, except that which
affected the teeth: on account of which they used to go up to the
metropolis, in word to consult the Delphic oracle but in deed to
go to Olympia, so that not a few were banished from the city both
for other reasons and not least this.)&nbsp; As to the causes of
it, then, let any one speak who is aware of them: but I will show
what things happened on account of it, having both myself put on
an &aelig;ger and seen others similarly afflicted, so that I can
describe it with equal certainty more than the narrative of
another not having done so, but relying on the <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>incredibility
of historians more than the sureness of experience.</p>
<p>For in the first beginning of the sickness men remembered what
Homer says about the lower and higher animals in the Trojan
business&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>First did he assail the mules and fleet dogs, but
afterward, aiming at the men his piercing dart, he smote,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>seeing that now too not less but equally as much first, the
College Tutors were attacked, and next the scouts, and last of
all the men themselves.&nbsp; But most of all the scouts were
affected, and this caused the greatest calamity: so that a man
must often wish that his scout might recover, wishing indeed
contrary to nature, but being persuaded by the greatness of the
surrounding misfortune, lest he should suffer even worse things
at the hands of a scout&rsquo;s boy, or considering it terrible
if he shall lose even the daily enjoyment of his breakfast not
being brought to him.&nbsp; And all laws concerning meals were
brought into a state of confusion, so that many anticipated
taking the commons of another.&nbsp; And they welcomed the
hospitality of those outside the walls, regarding their hunger in
the present as much more important than another man&rsquo;s
inability to pay his debts in the future.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>But when the men themselves began to suffer, then indeed
the disease was the commencement of lawlessness to a greater
extent for the city.&nbsp; For cuttings of chapels and avoidings
of lectures, which are an agony for the present more than a
possession for ever, and in short all such things as the
indulgence of was formerly more disguised, these a man easily
dared to do, it being uncertain on the one hand whether his tutor
has the influenza, and on the other if he himself might not put
on an &aelig;ger before being hauled he should pay the
penalty.&nbsp; And though some, indeed, did things exactly
contrary to this, and being before unaccustomed now went in the
morning with a run to chapel in order that fewer being present
the paradoxicalness of their appearance when compared with the
multitude of those who were absent might gain them a prestige of
virtue not real but simulated&mdash;yet with most there was now
neither fear of the Dean by land nor by sea of their coaches:
disobeying whom they ate and drank all kinds of things contrary
to law, no one being willing to exert himself for that which
seemed to be honourable, and calculating that the present
abstention from pastry was not equivalent to the possibility of
being bumped in the future about as much and <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>not less than
if he had smoked three pipes and a cheroot.&nbsp; And not only
was injustice prevalent among those who were as yet in good
health, but many of those in the ships, being or seeming to
themselves to be sick, had their places taken by others
accustomed rather to fight upon the land, whose manly
inexperience, though in word more creditable than the cowardice
combined with experience of the others, was in reality less
powerful than the language which those on the bank thought worthy
to use concerning them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, about this time the Oxonians sent an expedition
against Cambridge, having manned a slow train to Bletchley,
Nicolaidas being commander second himself; and they advanced as
far as Third Trinity, and having ravaged part of the land and set
up a trophy, they returned home.</p>
<h2><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>HERODOTUS ON HORSEBACK</h2>
<p>At this time the Chancellor being among the Oxonii there was
instituted a contest of horses such as this nation is accustomed
to celebrate every spring.&nbsp; And this contest is of such a
kind, not being well arranged according at least to my
opinion:&mdash;Having dug trenches and built other ramparts
parallel indeed to each other but transversely to the running of
the horses themselves, they do not any longer stand round them
invoking the gods as those do who play golf, but on the contrary,
when they have placed men upon horses they cause them to cross
these by leaping under the lash, as far as the goal: and whoever
anticipates the others arriving at the goal, sitting at least on
the same horse on which sitting he set out, and not it running,
having left him behind, nor he himself on foot, he is considered
to have conquered.&nbsp; The reason why I said that this contest
is not well arranged, is of the following kind: because it being
possible to contend in a level <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>place without
danger or difficulty, the Oxonii nevertheless themselves make
obstacles so as to prevent the horses from (not) arriving at the
end of the course, neither being compelled nor there being any
necessity
(&omicron;&#8016;&delta;&epsilon;&mu;&#8055;&eta;&sigmaf;
&#7936;&nu;&alpha;&gamma;&kappa;&alpha;&#8055;&eta;&sigmaf;
&#7952;&omicron;&#8059;&sigma;&eta;&sigmaf;).&nbsp; Then,
however, they did these things, and also, as they are accustomed
to do on such occasions, they sent messengers to inquire of other
prophets and also of the Delphic oracle who should be the
conqueror.&nbsp; The Pythian priestess, being mindful how she had
formerly made a good shot in respect of the Median business,
replied in the hexameter rhythm that the issues of victory lay
around a wooden wall.&nbsp; Now having this as a proof I will
neither refuse to believe in oracles myself nor allow others to
disbelieve them.&nbsp; For when the race had begun and the horses
had been sent away by the sound of a trumpet, other men were
taking part in the contest, and also Pheron the son of Trapezites
a Corinthian: this is not the Pheron who, his father having
founded a city, was himself expelled from it by the few, who were
called Hetairi, because he had allied himself with the democracy
forsooth (&delta;&eta;&theta;&epsilon;&nu;).&nbsp; And there are
other things written about this Pheron in the history composed by
Proctor, who was tyrant of Oxonia second himself for one year,
and in fact caused <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Pheron to fall out by reason of
sedition.&nbsp; What I have said just now is a digression and
refers to other matters, and I will now come back to my former
story.&nbsp; So then the men, having in the first part of the
contest done things worthy of themselves, and having for the most
part, although not all, yet the majority, avoided the (not)
falling into ditches and the like incurably at least, came
presently to the wooden fence, which I conjecture to be the wall
meant by the Delphic oracle.&nbsp; It being then necessary either
remaining on the hither side to be driven away from all hope of
the prize or leaping to run risks concerning their lives, and the
rest having leapt in such a way that they crossed the fence
sitting rather upon the ground than upon their horses, and some
neither with them nor upon them, as the Laced&aelig;monians say
about their shields: this Pheron, of whom I have before made
mention, showed himself to be prudent in other things and also in
this.&nbsp; He, having a horse much the most active of all the
rest, was not left behind by it, but sat there holding on firmly
until he had arrived at the farther side; and from thence, the
race being easy for him, he came to the goal very much the first,
having anticipated.&nbsp; In this way he obtained the
prize.&nbsp; I have learnt the names of all the other <!-- page
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>competitors: but I do not think it proper to relate
them, not now at least.</p>
<p>When the spectators had seen these things (and there was also
a contest for the natives of the country, in which not a few were
roughly handled) they returned in chariots to the city, driving
not straight like the Greeks, but obliquely, as is
customary.&nbsp; This story some relate, relating things credible
to me at least; there being two Oxonii in one chariot, and no one
else, one of them entreated the other after they had gone some
way without misfortune that he also might be allowed to hold the
reins of the horses: to whom the other replied
&ldquo;But&mdash;for do you not already hold them?&rdquo;&nbsp;
These men then having left such a memorial of themselves did
nevertheless arrive safely at the city.</p>

(<span class="smcap">i.</span>) <span class="smcap">the true tale
of troy</span></h2>
<p>(It is perhaps not generally known that the <i>Daily
Hieroglyphic</i>, one of the leading morning papyri of Egypt
under the --th Dynasty, despatched a special correspondent to
Greece at the time of the Trojan War.&nbsp; Some fragments of his
communications have been discovered by the energy of modern
tomb-robbers, and the courtesy of the British Museum has enabled
us to publish these <i>disjecta membra</i>, which may perhaps be
of interest to the public at the present juncture.)</p>
<p>The only social <i>&eacute;v&eacute;nement</i> (writes the
correspondent under date Jan. 10, 1100 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span>, or thereabouts) which I have to
chronicle is a reported domestic <i>esclandre</i> in the family
of Menelaus, the genial and popular Prince of Sparta.&nbsp; In
consequence of this the Princess Helena, it is alleged, has gone
to Paris.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Mycenae,
January 12.</p>
<p>It appears from the <i>Court Circular</i> that Her Royal
Highness has been advised by her physicians to reside for some
time in Asia Minor.&nbsp; At the same time I cannot conceal the
fact that the Corinthian society paper, <i>Alethea</i>, mentions
the name of a Trojan prince in connexion with this story.&nbsp; I
am naturally unwilling to make myself the mouthpiece of
scandal.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">February 1.</p>
<p>The fact can no longer be disguised that grave international
complications are likely to arise between Troy and Mycenae.&nbsp;
It is stated on the highest authority that the Argive ambassador
has been recalled from the former capital, the alleged reason
being promotion to a still higher diplomatic post: there seems,
however, to be no reasonable doubt that the practical rupture of
relations between the Empires of the West and East is not
remotely connected with the eternal maxim, &ldquo;Cherchez la
femme.&rdquo;&nbsp; Much sympathy is expressed with H.R.H. Prince
Menelaus.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">February 20.</p>
<p>Everything points to war.&nbsp; Orders for a substantial
increase of the Navy have been placed in <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>the hands of
Messrs. Odysseus &amp; Co., the celebrated firm of
shipbuilders.&nbsp; Heroes are earnestly called for.</p>
<p>The Argive Chamber was, last Wednesday, the scene of an
animated debate.&nbsp; M. Diomedes, War Minister, demanded a vote
which would enable him to enrol three more phalanxes.&nbsp; He
was bitterly opposed by M. Thersites, Leader of the Extreme Left,
who demanded to know why the Achaean nation was to be plunged
recklessly into war for the settlement of matters properly
pertaining to the province of a Divorce Court.&nbsp; Fortunately
for the success of M. Diomedes&rsquo; proposal, the closure was
put in operation.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Later.</p>
<p>M. Thersites&rsquo; funeral is announced for to-morrow (about
the time of loosing oxen).</p>
<p style="text-align: right">February 25.</p>
<p>I cannot better describe the existing political situation than
by quoting the opinion of leading newspapers in Achaea and
elsewhere.</p>
<p>All the official journals are consistently warlike in
tone.&nbsp; They declare that nothing will satisfy Achaean
aspirations but the annexation of Helen.&nbsp; The Athenian
<i>Asty</i> declares that should King <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Agamemnon
employ the opened floodgates of popular enthusiasm as a
stepping-stone to lop off another limb from the decaying trunk of
the (so-called) Trojan Empire, he will have achieved a permanent
blessing to civilization.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <i>Olympian Times</i> comments severely
on the precipitate action of Agamemnon, and animadverts on the
rash proceedings which have led to a rupture that might have been
averted by diplomacy.&nbsp; As the <i>Times</i> is understood to
be the mouthpiece of the Powers, such an utterance may well give
rise to the gravest apprehensions.</p>
<p>The <i>Oracle</i>&mdash;a Phocian organ of pronounced clerical
tendencies&mdash;preserves an ambiguous tone.</p>
<p>Everything indicates a warlike attitude on the part of the
<i>entourage</i> of King Priam.&nbsp; Hector Pasha has been
appointed War Minister.&nbsp; The <i>Prehistoric Post</i> speaks
of the enlistment of two new regiments of Hittite Bashi-Bazouks
in the interior of Asia Minor.&nbsp; The <i>Cassandra</i>,
however, a journal little read although supposed by some to be
inspired, has constituted itself the organ of the peace party,
and confidently predicts the destruction of Troy.</p>
<p>The <i>Ephemerios Chronographos</i> has received the following
telegram from the veteran statesman <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Nestor:
&ldquo;Profound sympathy Achaean aspirations.&nbsp; Bag and
baggage only possible policy.&nbsp; Postcard

<p style="text-align: right">March 1.</p>
<p>His Majesty and the Greek Fleet sailed to-day from Epidaurus,
amid scenes of great enthusiasm.&nbsp; Her Majesty the Queen and
His Excellency Count Aegisthus were both visibly affected.&nbsp;
Mycenae is daily paraded by crowds shouting, &ldquo;To
Ilion!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">March 8.</p>
<p>The Fleet is at Aulis, waiting until the process of raising
the wind shall have been concluded.&nbsp; Meantime, the services
of the notorious Klepht Achilles have been engaged.&nbsp; This
popular enlistment creates great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The report recently prevalent as to human sacrifices is
contradicted this morning by an official
<i>d&eacute;menti</i>.</p>
<p>H.R.H. the Princess Iphigeneia has joined a Russian religious
house.</p>
<p>Trojan bonds are quoted to-day at 53.8 (a fall of 0.2).</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Later.</p>
<p>The attitude of the Olympian Powers causes considerable
anxiety.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><!-- page 29--><a

March 15.</p>
<p>Telegrams per Beacon will have informed you that the Powers
have issued a Collective Note to the Greek expeditionary force,
forbidding the landing of heroes and others.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding this, there seems to be no doubt that several
demi-gods under Achilles have landed, and are endeavouring to
effect administrative reforms.&nbsp; Achaean newspapers of all
shades condemn the recent action of Poseidon in attempting to
raise a storm.&nbsp; Hector Pasha is committing atrocities.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">March 17.</p>
<p>In spite of the known discrepancy between the views of the
Powers, they have issued a Collective Note urging upon His
Majesty King Agamemnon the necessity of prompt withdrawal.&nbsp;
In view of his possible refusal, it is understood that
thunderbolts are in preparation, and Ares has been
mobilized.&nbsp; This action is severely commented upon by the
Achaean Press in general.&nbsp; The <i>Phaeacian Daily
Chronicle</i> goes so far as to threaten a mass meeting in
Trafalgar Square.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Hector Pasha is committing
atrocities.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">March 18.</p>
<p>The Powers have issued Collective Notes to the <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>contending parties.&nbsp; It is understood that nothing
short of a <i>Deus ex machina</i> can avert a formal rupture of
relations between the Courts of Troy and Mycenae, as acts which
are liable to the interpretation of belligerency are daily
committed.</p>
<p>The ambiguous attitude of Zeus tends to complicate the
situation.&nbsp; His Majesty the King narrowly missed being hit
by a thunderbolt this morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">March 20.</p>
<p>I am authorized to state that the intervention of a <i>Deus ex
machina</i> has brought about the arrangement of a <i>modus
vivendi</i>.&nbsp; The Achaean expeditionary force is to
withdraw, and Helen is to be autonomous.&nbsp; Menelaus, however,
is to be free to enforce administrative reforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">March 21.</p>
<p>Peace with Honour has been proclaimed.&nbsp; It is possible,
however, that some embarrassment may still arise from the action
of King Priam in assessing the material, moral, and intellectual
damage inflicted on himself and his allies at 152,833 tripods, 18
women, and an ox.&nbsp; This sum will certainly be disputed.</p>
<p>It is asserted as probable that the Poet <!-- page 31--><a

<p>The Roman correspondent of the <i>Stella Lugdunensis</i>
writes to his paper under date <span class="smcap">a.v.c.</span>
817:&mdash;</p>
<p>All the Press is naturally full of the recent debate in the
Senate on the alleged unconstitutional indiscretions of our
Imperial Master.&nbsp; (H.I.M., I should add, is at present on a
lecturing tour in the Peloponnesus; statements in the <i>Custos
Burdigalensis</i> to the effect that He is giving a series of
violin recitals are wholly without foundation.)&nbsp; The
impression produced is on the whole one of unanimous condemnation
of His Majesty&rsquo;s recent action.&nbsp; How&mdash;it is
argued even by the Right&mdash;can it tend to the stability of
Roman foreign policy that in the regrettable military operations
between the Suebi and the Chatti the Emperor should have directed
General Count Corbulo to prepare an invincible plan of campaign
for each of the belligerents?&nbsp; The <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Extreme Left,
as represented by Messrs. Barea and T. Peters (? Paetus), goes
much farther, and does not hesitate to criticize the autocratic
dilettantism which professes to lay down the law on artistic
matters which it does not in the least understand.&nbsp; It is
time (said one speaker) that our so-called Emperor should cease
to be persuaded by the plaudits of a decadent and servile
entourage into imagining Himself a Second Sarasatius.&nbsp;
Absolutism is generally condemned.</p>
<p>Messrs. Nerva and Nymphidius and other prominent Imperialists
have, of course, defended their master; but their apologies, it
is felt, were somewhat perfunctory and half-hearted.&nbsp; In
allusion to the lamented demise of the Dowager Empress, it was
pointed out that pity and loyalty alike should forbid trampling
on a Ruler bowed down by repeated domestic bereavements; and
attempts were made to enlist sympathy for the Imperial
Orphan.&nbsp; These, however, have not been uniformly crowned
with success.</p>
<p>Tension undoubtedly exists.&nbsp; I cannot (to speak plainly)
conceal from myself the fact that in a given contingency, the
nature of which it is unnecessary and, perhaps, undesirable to
specify further, circumstances at present unforeseen might
conceivably pave <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span

might be impossible to predict the eventual termination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ought Nero to Abdicate?&rdquo; is the subject of a
&ldquo;symposium&rdquo; in the current <i>Primum Saeculum et

with the talented author whose <i>Pharsalia</i> has long been
recognized as the most charming of Saturnalian gift-books, and
the Rev. L. A. Seneca, formerly private tutor in His
Majesty&rsquo;s household.&nbsp; Should H.I.M. decide to
abdicate, it is anticipated that He will edit our Boeotian
contemporary the <i>Oracle</i>, which is sadly in need of new
blood.&nbsp; Nero will give it that.&nbsp; The meetings held at
the Palazzo Pisone were strictly private.</p>

<p>The Suebian Press continues to hint at fresh
indiscretions.&nbsp; There is no doubt that a state of tension
exists, which can only be alleviated by the restoration of
reciprocal confidence between H.I.M. and the Roman people.&nbsp;
The result of the approaching conference between the Emperor and
Prince Tigellinus is eagerly discussed.</p>

38</span>PHILOGEORGOS, OR CONCERNING BRIBERY</h2>
<p>Going down the other day to the Kerameikos, I met my friend
Philogeorgos, who is at present one of those who desire to hold
office in the city.&nbsp; And I said to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philogeorgos, you look sad; is it because you fear lest
you should not be elected Archon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Socrates,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not
that which saddens me; it is the baseness of those who try to
prevent the people from choosing me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way do they act basely?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a certain wine-seller,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;who is offering what the Hyperboreans call Free Drinks
(that is, you know, draughts of wine without payment) to all
those who will vote for Misogeorgos, but not for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very unkind of the wine-seller.&nbsp; But why
do you say that the transaction is base?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course it is base.&nbsp; How can it be anything
else?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>&ldquo;When we predicate baseness of a
transaction,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we must also predicate
baseness of those who are concerned in it, or at least of one of
them.&nbsp; Now, Philogeorgos, let me ask you a question; for you
are accustomed by this time to answer questions.&nbsp; When you
wish for a pair of shoes or a flute, how do you obtain
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How else,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;except by buying it
from a shoemaker or a maker of flutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How else, indeed?&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;So,
then, the tradesman gives you something which he possesses; and
you give the tradesman in return something which you
possess.&nbsp; And this exchange is advantageous to both of you,
and honourable; is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And neither of you becomes base?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is not a base transaction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now consider in this way; Does a vote belong to the man
who possesses a vote?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Socrates; but I am afraid that you are going to
quibble, as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only by dialectic,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that
we can arrive at the truth.&nbsp; And the wine belongs, I
suppose, to the wine-seller?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&ldquo;It would seem so, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then when the wine-seller gets the voter&rsquo;s vote
in exchange for his own wine, they simply give each other what
each possesses; and such a transaction, as you have said, is
advantageous to both parties, and honourable, and not base at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; he replied, rather angrily, &ldquo;that
you were going to quibble.&nbsp; Of course, the case is quite
different.&nbsp; A vote is a sacred thing; and it ought not to be
exchanged for the satisfaction of mere bodily desires, such as
the desire for drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor for any other material comfort?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobly spoken, indeed!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
confess, all the same, that you rather surprise me; for only this
morning I heard the herald proclaiming in your name that all the
citizens would have Free Food if they voted for
Philogeorgos.&nbsp; And I remember how some years ago either
Phaidrolithos or one of those around him used to promise at
elections that everyone should have three acres of land and a
cow, on condition that the city kept him and his party in
power.&nbsp; You do not mean to tell me that what Phaidrolithos
or his friends did was base?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;But surely,
Socrates, <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>even you must see that this is a
different matter altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How different?&nbsp; You say that votes must not be
exchanged for material comforts; yet Free Food is a material
comfort; and so are three acres, because they produce food; and
so, I presume, is a cow.&nbsp; And these things were offered to
the voter in exchange for his vote, just as the wine-seller now
is offering draughts of wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Socrates, it is not the same thing at all.&nbsp;
When I talk of Free Food, and when men like Phaidrolithos talk of
land and cows, we do not give these things immediately in
exchange for votes.&nbsp; We could not; they are not ours to
give; we have not got them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I
remember when Phaidrolithos and his party were put in power many
people used to come to those in authority and demand that they
should now receive three acres of land each and a cow; and when
they did not receive these things they were indignant, as having
been deceived.&nbsp; And I daresay that when you are in power men
will come expecting to receive Free Food, and will not get
it.&nbsp; But, as far as I can understand your argument, it is
honourable to promise in return for a vote that which you cannot
give; but when <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>one promises that which he <i>can</i>
give, as the wine-seller does, that is base, and that makes you
sad.&nbsp; Is it not so?&nbsp; And the reason seems to be that
when the wine-seller offers Free Drinks for a vote, then the vote
is sold; but when you offer Free Food for a vote, then it is not
the vote which is sold, but only the voter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Socrates,&rdquo; said Philogeorgos, &ldquo;you are a
philosopher; and no philosopher ever understood politics.&nbsp;
But I am busy, and have really no more time to waste upon you and
your dialectics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, then, Philogeorgos,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but
please do not be angry with me for being so stupid.&nbsp; And if
I were you,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I do not think I would be
angry with the wine-seller either; for perhaps the draughts of
wine will make the citizens drunk, especially when they need not
be paid for; and when a citizen is drunk he will run the risk of
voting for you rather than for Misogeorgos.&nbsp; Do you not
think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Philogeorgos was already out of hearing.</p>

43</span>PHILELEUTHEROS; OR, CONCERNING THE PEOPLE&rsquo;S
WILL</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Is not this a dreadful thing, Socrates, that Balphurios
has been lately doing about what he calls a
Referendum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thing?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard
indeed lately that he has said this&mdash;that if he and his
friends should be elected to sit in the Ecclesia, he will not
propose a law taxing Megarian imports without first consulting
the citizens; and he has invited Asko&iuml;thios to do the same
thing, and not to give autonomy to the Samians without first
consulting the citizens.&nbsp; Is that the dreadful
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So dreadful, Socrates, that even now I can scarcely
believe it: for it aims at the destruction of the
democracy.&nbsp; But I can tell him that Asko&iuml;thios will
certainly not do what he is invited to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why will he not do it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Asko&iuml;thios knows very well already that
all the citizens are in favour of giving autonomy to the
Samians.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>&ldquo;Well, Phileleutheros,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;in
that case he will do no harm by having consulted them.&nbsp; And
does Balphurios also know what the citizens think about taxing
Megarian imports?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly: he knows that all men (except himself and
his friends) abhor such a plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;no harm will be done there
either; for the citizens, being consulted, will say what they
wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Socrates, it is always harmful that the citizens
should be consulted.&nbsp; And that is why Asko&iuml;thios will
not consult them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Phileleutheros,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are you not
a democrat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in a democracy do not the people rule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By saying what they wish to have done, or
otherwise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By saying so, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they are not allowed to say what they wish, they
are not ruling, and it is not a democracy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Balphurios, who asks the people what they wish, is
a democratic man; and Asko&iuml;thios, <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>who does not
ask them, is not a democratic man; nor are you one, apparently, O
Phileleutheros.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all nonsense, Socrates,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Balphurios cannot be a democrat: for I am a democrat, and
I do not agree with Balphurios.&nbsp; And you have not the least
conception of what is meant by democracy: which is, that certain
persons are chosen by the majority of the citizens that they may
sit in the Ecclesia and carry out the wishes of the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for what reasons do you choose such persons?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to be chosen, Socrates,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;because they possess the qualities proper to democratic
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that they must hate and
speak evil of the rich; and that they must wish to diminish the
number of our triremes; and that they must refuse to tax Megarian
imports; and that they must be conscious of their own virtues and
the vices of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not altogether praise your definition; but it will
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But with all these qualities,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;will your ecclesiasts always know what you wish when
something unexpected happens about which it is necessary to
decide?&nbsp; For instance, if one of the chief speakers <!--
page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>proposes a law that all burglars should be honoured by
dinners in the Prytaneum, will not your ecclesiasts come to us
and say, &lsquo;O Socrates and Phileleutheros, we possess all the
qualities proper to democratic men: we are conscious of our own
virtues, and we should like to diminish the number of your
triremes: and for these qualities we have been elected; but as to
this matter of giving burglars a dinner in the Prytaneum, about
this we do not yet know your wishes: and we would gladly be
informed by you?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they do not know our wishes of themselves,&rdquo;
said Phileleutheros, &ldquo;they will suffer for it at the next
election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very unpleasant for them,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose now that you hired an architect to
build you a house, and that while he was building it he needed
your advice, and came and said to you, &lsquo;O Phileleutheros, I
have given your house four walls and a roof according to your
wishes; but you have not yet told me whether your banqueting-hall
ought to have three windows or six.&nbsp; About this I do not yet
know your wishes, and I would gladly be informed by
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Will you then say to him that you have no
authority to tell him your wishes any more, but that if he
happens to decide contrary to your will you will not employ him
again?&nbsp; Similarly, it seems <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>to me, you
are in danger of making the Ecclesia no longer the agent of your
wishes, but it and those who lead it will be now and then tyrants
and not your servants&mdash;if to make laws not according to the
will of the people is tyranny.&nbsp; And you can punish the
ecclesiasts by dismissing them after a time, of course; but you
will only elect others who will be tyrants again in the same way
as their predecessors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Nomothetae, Socrates, will prevent
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;For your leaders
of the Ecclesia, who are democrats and will not consult the
people, and whom you praise, will ask the Nomothetae for their
opinion three times; and when thereby they are quite satisfied
that their proposal is displeasing to the Nomothetae it will
forthwith become law.&nbsp; So that the conclusion is this: that
the leaders of the Ecclesia will in most cases have authority to
do what they like without consulting anybody.&nbsp; And these
leaders, Asko&iuml;thios and his friends, are few in relation to
the mass of the citizens, are they not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not many, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is something to be thankful for,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They then, being few, will rule for the time;
and when the few rule, that is oligarchy.&nbsp; Is it not?&nbsp;
Unless perhaps you will say that when your enemies <!-- page
48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>are
in power in the Ecclesia, it is oligarchy; but when your friends
are in power, then it is democracy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Socrates, you are right, for once.&nbsp; That is
precisely what I do say.&rdquo;</p>

49</span>THE TUTOR&rsquo;S EXPEDIENT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come in&rdquo; said the Senior Tutor of St. Boniface:
and two scholars came in.&nbsp; (He knew they were scholars,
because this was his hour for seeing scholars.)&nbsp; One was a
heavy-looking young man in a frock coat and tall hat.&nbsp; The
other was a spruce youth, who looked as if nature had intended
him for an attorney&rsquo;s clerk; as, indeed, nature had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scholars, I presume, gentlemen?&rdquo; inquired the
Tutor.&nbsp; The young men bowed.&nbsp; &ldquo;In what subjects,
may I ask?&nbsp; You, sir&rdquo; (turning to the spruce youth)
&ldquo;Mr.&mdash;I forget your name&mdash;eh?&nbsp; Oh,
thanks&mdash;is it Classics?&nbsp; History?&nbsp; Natural
Science, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, sir; I hold a &lsquo;Daily Thunderer&rsquo;
Scholarship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly: I remember now.&nbsp; You read all through
<i>Tit-Bits</i> for a whole year, and the &lsquo;D. T.&rsquo;
pays you&mdash;&pound;l,200, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; The task is a
little dear at the price, it always seemed to me: but still,
<i>Tit-Bits</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t quite that, sir,&rdquo; put in the
youth; &ldquo;it was for the
&lsquo;Encyclop&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;I <i>knew</i> it was dear at the price,&rdquo; the
Tutor murmured.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;&mdash;&aelig;dia Pananglica,&rsquo;&rdquo;
continued the scholar.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Scholarship is for reading
that.&nbsp; I have it outside, in three packing-cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Scholarship?&rdquo; asked the Tutor, weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the scholar; &ldquo;the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Pananglica.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the academic dignitary resumed, &ldquo;and
what have you read?&nbsp; To prepare yourself for a university
career, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Encyc&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course; but anything else?&nbsp; I wish
to know so as to advise you with respect to the direction of your
studies.&nbsp; Have you, for instance, read any Homer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homer!&rdquo; the youth replied&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, yes, I
know about Homer.&nbsp; There is a picture of Homer, drawn from
life, and very well reproduced, among the illustrations of the
article &lsquo;Education.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is one there of
Comenius, too.&nbsp; Homer and Comenius&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were both educationists, I know,&rdquo; said the Tutor:
&ldquo;but not, properly speaking, in the same way.&nbsp;
However&mdash;you have not studied the father of <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>poetry in the original, it would appear.&nbsp; Any
Xenophon, perhaps? or C&aelig;sar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I know much about Xenophon,&rdquo;
replied the young man, &ldquo;but I have a friend who failed in
C&aelig;sar for the Cambridge Locals, and he said it was pretty
easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know <i>any</i> Greek or Latin at
all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I came along I bought a Delectus: I was told
it might be helpful for attaining the highest honours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&nbsp; You thought it might be helpful&mdash;of
course, of course.&nbsp; You were quite right&mdash;perfectly,
perfectly correct,&rdquo; the Tutor murmured, with a faraway look
in his eyes.&nbsp; Then he collected himself, and turned to the
other aspirant.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you, sir&mdash;pardon me, I
didn&rsquo;t quite catch&mdash;eh?&nbsp; Oh, thanks!&mdash;what,
may I ask, are the conditions on which you hold <i>your</i>
Scholarship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My education,&rdquo; replied the heavy young man,
&ldquo;was completed at the Jabez H. Brown University of
Thessalonica, Maine, U.S.A.&nbsp; I am a recipient of a
Scholarship under the provisions of the will of the Right
Honourable Cecil J. Rhodes, the eminent philanthropist.&nbsp; No
doubt, Professor, you will have heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! a Rhodes Scholar,&rdquo; said the Tutor.&nbsp; <!--
page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>&ldquo;That is better&mdash;much better.&nbsp; You will,
no doubt, study the Classics.&nbsp; There are those (I am well
aware) who are disposed to object to modern American Scholarship
as an excessive attention to minuti&aelig;: but personally, I
confess, I am no enemy even to a meticulous exactness, which
alone can save us from an incurious and slipshod rhetoric! . . .
And what, then, are the points of scholarship which it has been
your endeavour to elucidate?&nbsp; Have you followed in the steps
of the lamented Professor Drybones of Chicago, who died before he
could prove, by a complete enumeration of all the instances in
Greek literature, that &gamma;&#940;&rho; is never the first word
of a sentence?&nbsp; Have you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Professor,&rdquo; put in the Rhodes
Scholar.&nbsp; &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t my platform at all.&nbsp;
I may say, I don&rsquo;t take any stock in literatoor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I then to understand,&rdquo; the Tutor asked,
&ldquo;that you are <i>not</i> acquainted with the Greek and
Latin Classics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not considerable,&rdquo; replied the American.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In fact, not any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to what, then, have your studies been
directed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to books, Professor.&nbsp; No, nor yet laboratories
and such.&nbsp; I was elected Scholar by the <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>unanimous
suffrage of my class in Thessalonica, Maine, for Moral
Character.&nbsp; When it comes to Moral Character, you look at
me.&nbsp; That is just where I am on top every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moral Character!&rdquo; exclaimed the Tutor,
aghast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, dear me!&nbsp; I am afraid that
won&rsquo;t do at all&mdash;here.&nbsp; Moral
Character&mdash;well, I hardly know how to put it&mdash;but the
fact is that if <i>that</i> is all that you have to rely upon,
you would be sent down within a year infallibly&mdash;Oh,
infallibly, I assure you! . . .&nbsp; But,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;we must try to think of something for both of you
gentlemen.&nbsp; Could I not give you both a letter of
recommendation to my friend the Master of St.
Cuthbert&rsquo;s?&nbsp; <i>There</i>, I know, they value very
highly both morality and the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia
Pananglica.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am sure it would be just the place for
you both.&nbsp; Do let me write!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the Master of Alfred&rsquo;s sent Cecil Rhodes on to
Auriol?&rdquo; suggested the spruce young man, innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the Master of&mdash;why, no,&rdquo; said the Tutor,
&ldquo;I think that won&rsquo;t do, after all.&nbsp; Really, I
believe, we must try to keep you at Boniface.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Boniface had suffered severely from agricultural
depression.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, gentlemen&mdash;come to me again
two hours <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>hence, and we will try to think of
something for you.&nbsp; Good morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The Tutor was in a sad quandary.&nbsp; Paid as he was by
results fees, he could not afford to receive pupils who would
disgrace him in the Schools.&nbsp; Yet it had always been his
creed that a College must adapt itself to existing circumstances,
and be instinct with the Zeit Geist.</p>
<p>For a long time he remained wrapt in meditation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Two hours elapsed, and the Tutor was again confronted with the
twin aspirants to academic honours.&nbsp; He regarded them with
the mien of one visibly relieved from a load of care.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These papers, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, pointing to
certain documents which lay upon the tutorial table,
&ldquo;relate to a project of which you have doubtless
heard&mdash;I refer to the extension of our Public Schools into
the remoter regions of the British Empire.&nbsp; They are
reprinted from Mr. Sargant&rsquo;s admirable letter to the
<i>Times</i>, and the leading article on the subject.&nbsp; You
are acquainted with them&mdash;No?&nbsp; Then pray take the
papers: you will find them most instructive and agreeable reading
during the voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>&ldquo;The&mdash;the voyage?&rdquo; exclaimed the Rhodes
Scholar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the Tutor, &ldquo;during the
voyage.&nbsp; During the long afternoons when you are steaming
over the oily calm of the Bay of Biscay, or being propelled (by
friendly natives) down the rushing waters of
the&mdash;ah&mdash;Congo.&nbsp; What I am proposing is that you
two gentlemen should become members of our Branch Establishment
in Timbuctoo.&nbsp; You <i>must</i> have heard of it!&nbsp; When
schemes so beneficial to the Empire are mooted, was it likely
that the Colleges of our great Imperial Universities would not
take the lead in the van of progress?&nbsp; And when Eton,
Harrow, and Giggleswick have founded institutions, similar to
themselves in every respect except that of mere locality, in
Asia, Africa, and Australasia, was the College of St. Boniface to
be a laggard?&nbsp; Assuredly not.&nbsp; Gentlemen, I commend you
to our Alma Mater beyond the seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Professor,&rdquo; the Rhodes Scholar objected,
&ldquo;I was sent here across the salt water dish to join the
College of St. Boniface.&nbsp; They were kind of sot upon that in
Thessalonica.&nbsp; I guess they will be disappointed, some, if I
ain&rsquo;t made a professing member of St. Boniface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will be, my dear sir&mdash;you will be!&rdquo;
<!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>cried the Tutor, with vehemence, &ldquo;a member of St.
Boniface-in-Timbuctoo: Sancti Bonifacii Collegii apud
Timbuctooenses alumnus: it is precisely the same thing.&nbsp; You
have doubtless read, in the course of your historical
investigations, how Eton is really an offshoot of Winchester: is
Eton not a public school?&nbsp; Of course it is.&nbsp; Similarly,
in the Middle Ages a portion of the University broke off and
migrated to Stamford.&nbsp; Was it Oxford any the less because it
happened to be at Stamford?&nbsp; Not the least.&nbsp; The two
institutions&mdash;St. Boniface in Oxford and St. Boniface in
Timbuctoo&mdash;are precisely identical.&nbsp; When you gentlemen
in future years are competing for&mdash;and I trust, I am sure,
obtaining&mdash;positions of distinction and emolument in the
great world, you will be entitled to describe yourselves as
Boniface Men.&nbsp; You can drop the &lsquo;Apud
Timbuctooenses&rsquo; if you like: the omission will not be
considered fraudulent.&nbsp; But I see no reason why you
<i>should</i> drop it.&nbsp; Personally, I should glory in
it.&nbsp; Had I won a scholarship for Moral Character, I would go
to Timbuctoo to-morrow!&nbsp; There, it seems to me, is your
special sphere.&nbsp; In Oxford, Moral Character is so frequent
as to be a drug, a positive drug: but in Timbuctoo the possession
is precious in proportion to its rarity.&rdquo;</p>

very important.&nbsp; My family were especially
anxious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly they have got the Tone and the
Tradition.&nbsp; <i>Coelum non animum mutant</i>&mdash;you have
met with that, probably, in the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia
Pananglica.&rsquo;&nbsp; Absolutely unimpaired, I assure
you.&nbsp; We take great pains about that.&nbsp; Just an
instance&mdash;the Visitor is the Bishop of Barchester, just as
here with us: the local King wanted to be Visitor, but of course
we couldn&rsquo;t allow that.&nbsp; Imagine&mdash;a Visitor with
fifty-three wives, not to mention!&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t have
done at all: the Tone <i>must</i> have suffered.&nbsp; We are in
constant communication (wireless, of course) with the Timbuctoo
Branch: we are always being consulted.&nbsp; Only this morning we
had to deal rather severely with an undergraduate member of the
College&mdash;aboriginal, as many of them are&mdash;who insisted
on playing the tom-tom in prohibited hours.&nbsp; Of course, we
must back up the Dean, and in case of&mdash;emergency, we replace
him and compensate his relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak, sir,&rdquo; said the student of the
Encyclop&aelig;dia, &ldquo;of a local King.&nbsp; I understood
that the College was on British territory.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&ldquo;The British Empire,&rdquo; replied the Tutor,
&ldquo;includes Hinterlands.&nbsp; This is a Hinterland.&nbsp; It
is consequently from time to time the duty of the local college
authorities to assist the British Resident at the Court of
Timbuctoo in pulling down the French, German, Italian, Russian,
and Portuguese flags, all of which have been occasionally
erected.&nbsp; But the country is practically annexed.&nbsp; We
are&mdash;ah&mdash;suzerains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, Professor, from your observation relative
to the tom-tom,&rdquo; put the American scholar, &ldquo;that the
students of your College are subjected to the regular British
discipline?&nbsp; That would be kind of essential for me.&nbsp;
Cecil J. Rhodes, the eminent philanthropist, was particularly
anxious that I should have the full advantages of your fine old
high-toned medi&aelig;val College rules.&nbsp; You have
regulations, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The regulations,&rdquo; replied the Don, &ldquo;are
framed (as exactly as possible in the circumstances) on the lines
with which we are familiar in Oxford.&nbsp; It has not been
advisable, so far, to establish the Proctorial system in its
entirety throughout the capital of Timbuctoo; but within the
walls of St. Boniface (or perhaps in strict truth I should say
within the Zariba) the strictest discipline prevails.&nbsp; <!--
page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>Clothing is essential&mdash;if not worn, at least
carried in the hand&mdash;for attendance in Hall and at
lectures.&nbsp; Morning chapel is obligatory: conscientious
objectors, if aborigines, may keep a private fetish in their
rooms.&nbsp; Cannibalism is only permitted if directly authorized
by the Dean, after a personal interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This appeared to satisfy the Rhodes Scholar; his companion
wished further to know whether residence in a Colonial College
could be regarded as a step on the Educational Ladder.&nbsp; His
friends, he said, had impressed upon him that his function in
life was to climb the Educational Ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ladder to which you refer,&rdquo; explained the
Tutor, &ldquo;can be scaled as well in Africa as in
England.&nbsp; In fact, better; there are distinctly greater
facilities.&nbsp; In view of the regrettable inadequacy (at
present) of any organized system of primary education in
Timbuctoo, secondary education has been obliged to modify some of
its standards.&nbsp; The University of Oxford, never backward in
the march of progress, is prepared to make the requisite
concessions; and, as a result, you will find that the highest
honours are attainable without any acquaintance with the ordinary
subjects of our curriculum.&nbsp; It is, I should say, the very
place for you.&nbsp; Remember, too, that the very largest
latitude is allowed&mdash;nay, encouraged&mdash;<!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>in the choice
of special subjects qualifying for the M.A. degree; and what a
field you will find!&nbsp; The habits of residents&mdash;indeed,
of some among your own fellow students&mdash;are most interesting
to the student of Anthropology! while investigations among the
flora and fauna of this country must be fraught with the most
delightful potentialities.&nbsp; I confess, I envy you.&nbsp; I
do not think I am saying too much if I assure you that this
University will be ready and willing to confer upon you, not only
the ordinary M.A. degree, but a Doctorate of Science or
Letters!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued the Tutor, &ldquo;as to
recreations; <i>neque semper arcum tendit Apollo</i>&mdash;I beg
your pardon, I mean to say that you cannot always be studying the
domestic habits of the hippopotamus under a microscope.&nbsp;
Sports and games you will find plentiful and interesting.&nbsp;
There is head-hunting, for instance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunting the head of the college, do you mean,
Professor?&rdquo; asked the American.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied the Don, with
dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;That would not, under any circumstances, be
permitted.&nbsp; If it were the Dean, now&mdash;but, oh no,
certainly not the Head.&nbsp; What I refer to is the pursuit and
collection of decapitated human heads, belonging generally to
personal enemies of the <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>collector; it is a sport common in
Borneo, and among other interesting, if primitive,
nationalities.&nbsp; This pastime is, I understand, a favourite
one with some students of the college.&nbsp; It is practised, I
need hardly say, under the very strictest supervision; there must
be a certificate signed by the British Resident, and a special
written recommendation from the Director of the Craniological
Department of the Museum.&nbsp; Under such restriction abuse is,
of course, impossible.&nbsp; Then, again, there is golf; and it
is hardly necessary to remind you that the Sahara provides
perhaps the finest natural golf links in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Professor,&rdquo; said the American, &ldquo;I
guess I will start.&nbsp; But how are we going to get right
there, now?&nbsp; On the cars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Cape to Cairo railway, when it is open,&rdquo;
the Tutor answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;There will be a branch
line.&nbsp; At present, the main line is, as you are aware,
incomplete, and the branch is&mdash;well, in course of
construction.&nbsp; Passengers are conveyed by motor.&nbsp; Or,
if not by motor, by ox-waggon; trekking by the latter method is,
I believe, the safer way; both, however, are, I understand, most
commodious.&nbsp; I may explain to you that the present is a
particularly auspicious occasion for your journey; you will
travel <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>in the company of the new Junior
Dean, whose society, I am sure, you will find delightful.&nbsp;
His predecessor, a personal friend of my own, succumbed, I grieve
to say, a few months ago&mdash;owing to the alleged inadequate
supply of beef-steaks at a &lsquo;Torpid&rsquo; breakfast. . . .
Painful, but apparently inevitable.&nbsp; I need hardly say, the
perpetrators of this insult have been rusticated for a whole
term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the Junior Dean a coloured person&mdash;a
nigger?&rdquo; asked the Rhodes Scholar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>All</i> the College officials,&rdquo; explained the
Don, &ldquo;are, in the highest and best sense of the word, white
men.&nbsp; Some of the Ordinary Fellows, it is true&mdash;Mr.
Sargant&rsquo;s scheme contemplated, you see, the election to
fellowships of persons of local distinction.&nbsp; But our
officials are, without exception, Oxford men.&nbsp; It would be
impossible, otherwise, to preserve the Tone and the
Tradition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I must
not keep you too long.&nbsp; Procrastination is the thief of
time, eh? and besides, your boat leaves Southampton
to-morrow.&nbsp; All expenses on the journey refunded by the
Timbuctoo Bursar, on application.&nbsp; Are your boxes
unpacked?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Then all you have to do is to alter the
labels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
the spruce <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is in three
packing cases&mdash;a bit &rsquo;eavy.&nbsp; Will carriage be
paid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh certainly, certainly,&rdquo; replied the
Tutor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course, I <i>might</i> relax our
regulation about bonfires in the quadrangle&mdash;but no, no, I
am sure you will find it most useful, even up-to-date&mdash;in
Timbuctoo.&nbsp; <i>Good</i> morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The Tutor, with a sigh of relief, renewed his perusal of the
&ldquo;Itinerarium&rdquo; of Nemesianus.&nbsp; Nemesianus, honest
man! did not know where Timbuctoo was.&nbsp; Nor, for the matter
of that, did the Tutor.</p>
<h2><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>THE END AND OBJECT&mdash;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It is always interesting,&rdquo; said my friend,
Feedingspoon, &ldquo;to consider the various stages of the
process by which knowledge is disseminated.&nbsp; An inscription
(we will say) or an important textual variation is discovered: it
is then misinterpreted to fit a preconceived theory; then it is
introduced into a cheap German edition, for the School-Use
explained.&nbsp; Subsequently, an English school-book is copied
from the German: the English commentary is imparted (by me) to
undergraduates, in the form of lectures; and the
undergraduates&rsquo; notes are presently submitted to an
examiner in the Schools, who marks them <i>a</i>&mdash;?, and
says they show evidence of some original research.&nbsp; By how
many degrees, do you suppose, is the examiner removed from the
truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;whether he be a D.D.,
an M.A., or a D.Litt.&nbsp; But I do not understand the necessity
of the lecturer.&nbsp; Cannot your undergraduate read the English
book for himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;he cannot.&nbsp;
There are, of course, exceptional persons.&nbsp; But the ordinary
man&rsquo;s mind is so constructed that he is incapable of
comprehending that which is seen by the eyes unless it be also
heard by the ears.&nbsp; Moreover, when he is not safely shut up
in a lecture-room, he is almost always compelled to be either
eating, or playing football, or meeting his maternal uncle at the
station.&nbsp; Lastly, if the student could read for himself,
there would be no need of a lecturer: which is absurd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such being the admitted theory of education,&rdquo;
continued Feedingspoon, &ldquo;I feel that I am necessary to the
machinery of the Universe.&nbsp; The position which I occupy is
at the same time one of some labour.&nbsp; This morning, for
instance, I rose late (having been occupied till past midnight in
reading to my pupils selections from the <i>Poetics</i> of
Aristotle, in order that they might sleep soundly and wake
refreshed): hence, I was unable to follow my usual practice,
which is, to call my alumni at 6.30, to accompany them in a walk
before breakfast, and map out the scheme of reading which they
are to follow until luncheon.&nbsp; I only trust that this
isolated omission of a plain duty may not wreck their
futures!&nbsp; As a result of my somnolence, I had but ten
minutes in which to prepare two lectures on <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>subjects of
which I had previously been ignorant; but, thanks to Mr.
Gow&rsquo;s <i>Handbook to School Classics</i>&mdash;a work with
which my pupils are unfamiliar because I have not yet told them
to read it&mdash;I succeeded in displaying an erudition which, in
the circumstances, was creditable.&nbsp; Since the conclusion of
my lectures, I have been employed in visiting the candidates whom
I am preparing for examination, and encouraging them to continue
their studies.&nbsp; Personal attention is indispensable to the
true educator.&nbsp; But I must confess that I am somewhat dashed
and embarrassed by the receipt of a request from Tomkins, a
scholar of this College, that I should discontinue my daily
inspection of his reading, as he wishes to have time to do some
work: coupled with a letter from the Senior Tutor, who wishes to
know if I do not think that a little more individual attention is
advisable in the case of Tomkins. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ask you to excuse
me.&nbsp; The representatives of my College are about to play a
football match in the Parks: and although the game is one with
the rules of which I have never been able to familiarize myself,
and in which, between ourselves, I take no interest whatever, I
conceive that my absence from the crowd of spectators might <!--
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>well loosen that sympathy between myself and the junior
members of the College, without which they must infallibly meet
the fate of the man who reads his books for himself and neglects
the dictation of his Tutor.&nbsp; Moreover, I have to spend the
later part of the afternoon in reading the Cr--, I should say,
the admirable and scholarly version of Professor Jebb&mdash;to
three Commoners who are taking up Sophocles for Honour
Moderations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your day,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;seems indeed to be
somewhat occupied.&nbsp; Let me at least hope that the work which
you are doing will win you the applause of the learned, and a
place among the Educationists of the century.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On leaving Feedingspoon, it happened that the first man whom I
met was Fadmonger, <i>the</i> Fadmonger, the one with a
Continental reputation.&nbsp; He had been ordered to play golf in
the morning, and was returning from the links.&nbsp; As we walked
together towards the North of Oxford, I was about to repeat to
him the substance of my conversation with Feedingspoon.&nbsp; But
on my mentioning the latter&rsquo;s name, Fadmonger interposed,
and said that he really could not trust himself to speak on that
subject.&nbsp; He then discoursed upon it at great <!-- page
68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>length, using the most violent language about
Obscurantism, Packed Boards, the Tutorial Profession, Sacrifice
of Research to Examination, Frivolous Aims and Obsolete Methods,
and the like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; he cried indignantly, &ldquo;are we to
think of a curriculum&mdash;so called&mdash;which includes the
<i>Republic</i> of Plato and excludes the <i>Onomasticon</i> of
Julius Pollux?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;there can be only
one opinion about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you are one of the few
sensible men I know.&nbsp; Our methods, I can tell you, are
getting us into serious discredit abroad.&nbsp; I should just
like you to hear the things which are said about Liter&aelig;
Humaniores by Professor Jahaleel Q. Potsherds of Johns Hopkins,
and Doctor Grabenrauber of Weissnichtwo.&nbsp; They think very
little of this University at Johns Hopkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I am pained to hear
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Fadmonger; &ldquo;it worries me a
good deal.&nbsp; I have almost resolved to give up the rest of my
lectures for the Term, and go to the Riviera for a complete
change. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause, &ldquo;there is
nothing to be hoped from the College Tutor.&nbsp; Obscurantist he
is, and obscurantist he will remain: <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>he is our
great impediment to serious study&mdash;study, that is, of
anything except so-called classical texts.&nbsp; It is to the
young student that we must look for salvation.&nbsp; Do you know
young Frawde of my College?&nbsp; I have had most interesting
talks with him&mdash;a really able man, but of course quite
misunderstood by his tutors: able men always are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, I suppose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;reading for a
Final Honour School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he is doing nothing of the kind,&rdquo;
Fadmonger replied with some warmth.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the present
degraded condition of Honour Greats it is quite unworthy of a
serious student.&nbsp; He is at present preparing to take a pass
degree: and after that he thinks of going abroad to devote
himself seriously to a course of Tymborychology.&nbsp; A most
interesting young man, with admirably sound ideas on the present
state of the Schools. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It happens that I know Frawde: and when I next met him I
commented with some surprise on his new departure.&nbsp; Frawde
was quite candid, and said it had been necessary to do something
in order to patch up his much-ploughed character before
Collections.&nbsp; He had been plausible, and Fadmonger
credulous.</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;And really, you know, the Fadder wasn&rsquo;t
half a bad chap&rdquo;&mdash;he had given Frawde a recommendation
to read in the Bodder&mdash;&ldquo;and I am going there
too,&rdquo; said the serious student, &ldquo;as soon as I can
find out where it is: but nobody seems to know.&nbsp; After all,
lots of chaps go abroad after their degraggers: why
shouldn&rsquo;t I have a spade and dig in Egypt or Mesopotamia or
somewhere, same as anybody else?&nbsp; Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, upon my word, I really don&rsquo;t see why he
shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

71</span>THE TORTURED TUTOR:<br />
A DIALOGUE OF THE DEAD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; said Pluto to the deceased
Tutor, &ldquo;which of our penalties we can assign to you.&nbsp;
Something you must have, you know: it&rsquo;s the rule of the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to hear you say so,&rdquo; replied the
Tutor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I <i>had</i> hoped that perhaps I might be
allowed a little quiet to enjoy the pleasant warmth&mdash;my
doctor really sent me here as an alternative to Algiers&mdash;and
possibly throw in a little journalistic work which would
advertise you in the evening papers.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not known
enough up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not known?&nbsp; Why, surely you yourself must often
have been recommended to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; the Tutor hastily
interrupted,&mdash;&ldquo;but not by any one whose opinion or
advice I at all respected.&nbsp; Whereas if I might just have
leisure to look round and jot things down, now that I am here, I
could put you in touch with specialists who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said the Monarch,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;re going to stay here at all, you must please
to remember that this isn&rsquo;t a University.&nbsp; I simply
won&rsquo;t have idlers loafing round wasting their own time and
demoralizing society with their lazy habits.&nbsp; Pardon my
abruptness&rdquo; (he continued, more mildly), &ldquo;but with
all the exclusiveness in the world I can&rsquo;t prevent our
getting a little mixed now and then, and if people come here with
academic ideas I really couldn&rsquo;t be responsible for order
and morality.&nbsp; We should be as Anglo-Indian as Olympus in no
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true! very true!&rdquo; said the Shade.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I quite see.&nbsp; Satan finds some mischief
still&mdash;eh? as I used to say when I was a Dean.&nbsp; Since
you really insist on it, I suppose there <i>had</i> better be
some trifling torture by way of occupation.&nbsp; Only look
here&mdash;it mustn&rsquo;t be any of the things I used to do up
above.&nbsp; Quite absurd, you know, to go on reading the same
books you did at school&mdash;no, I mean, to be made to continue
on the same old lines I followed before I came up&mdash;down, I
should say.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so monotonous, and it isn&rsquo;t
improving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Pluto, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see what
can be done, on that assumption.&nbsp; It does rather limit
possibilities, though, doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; You see I have to
<!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>confess that, considering it&rsquo;s the nineteenth
century, we are a little behind the times&mdash;no great variety
in the matter of punishments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you bring them up to date?&rdquo; asked
the visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
question of expense.&nbsp; With funds, I could do much
more.&nbsp; Roasting over a slow fire, for instance, is good:
they have that in another place: but just think of the coal
bill!&nbsp; Then viva-voceing and vivisecting without
an&aelig;sthetics are of course admirable; but the cost of expert
labour involved would be ruinous.&nbsp; Result is, that nearly
all my penalties are self-acting and consequently simple in
design; and, on the whole, except in the case of
<i>blas&eacute;s</i> people who come here with a too varied
experience, they answer tolerably well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Tutor, &ldquo;suggest an
occupation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said the Ruler of the Shades, and he
pondered a few moments.&nbsp; &ldquo;How would it be, now, if you
were to take a turn with our friend Sisyphus?&nbsp; He rolls a
big stone up a hill, and just as he thinks it&rsquo;s going to
get to the top, down it comes again&mdash;most
disappointing.&nbsp; Quite inexpensive, and very healthy,
<i>I</i> should say, and really, <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>as an
object-lesson in the force of gravity, not
uninstructive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do at all,&rdquo; replied the Tutor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the Vacations I was always walking up hills and having
to come down before I got to the top.&nbsp; Then in the Term I
used to teach Logic to passmen; and really, if you
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Pluto agreed; &ldquo;the occupations
would be practically identical.&nbsp; Of course, that won&rsquo;t
suit you.&nbsp; Well, then, there&rsquo;s Ixion, who goes round
on a wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bicyclist myself,&rdquo; objected the
Tutor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&nbsp; Pity, too, because Ixion says his
wheel&rsquo;s old-fashioned; he wants a new one with pneumatic
tyres warranted puncturable, which shows that he is really
entering into the spirit of the thing.&nbsp; You might have had
his old one for a song, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; However, what do
you say to calling on those Danaid girls, and getting them to
teach you their little industry?&nbsp; There, again, you have
simplicity itself.&nbsp; Take a can with a hole in the bottom, go
on pouring water into it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I told you,&rdquo; murmured the deceased,
wearily, &ldquo;that I have followed the profession of
teaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true; I had forgotten.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t know what
<!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>we can do to suit you, really!&nbsp; Perhaps you&rsquo;d
like to imitate Theseus&mdash;<i>sedet aeternumque sedebit</i>,
as Virgil said.&nbsp; Astonishing how Virgil picked these details
up!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s old Theseus, sitting like a hen.&nbsp;
They say he&rsquo;s as tired of sitting as if he were a
rowing-man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an ex-member of the Board of the Faculty of
Arts&mdash;&rdquo; began the Tutor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, dear me!&rdquo; replied Pluto.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
that won&rsquo;t do either?&nbsp; Those Boards must be excellent
from my point of view.&nbsp; I have often wished I had one or two
down here.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m really afraid we&rsquo;re getting
to the end of the list.&nbsp; And, you know, if we can&rsquo;t
provide you with anything, back you&rsquo;ll have to go.&nbsp;
<i>I</i> won&rsquo;t keep you, eating your head off.&nbsp; But,
talk of eating! shall I put you up beside Prometheus, and ask his
eagle to do a little overtime work by taking a turn at your
liver?&nbsp; I am afraid we could hardly stand you a private
eagle all to yourself.&nbsp; It is said to be quite painful; I
really don&rsquo;t think you can have gone through that, with all
your experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes I have,&rdquo; returned the Tutor; &ldquo;a long
course of Hall dinners has familiarized me with every possibility
in the way of liver trouble.&nbsp; The eagle business would be
the merest <i>crambe repetita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;Bless the man!&rdquo; cried Pluto, justly
provoked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well; then you can&rsquo;t stay here,
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve given you all the alternatives
Hades has at its disposal, and you tell us you have been through
them all in your University!&nbsp; All I can say is, you had
better go back to it, and stay there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bursar,&rdquo; said the Tutor, &ldquo;will not be
best pleased to see me again.&nbsp; He thinks he has got my
Fellowship, and is going to use it for the benefit of the College
farms.&nbsp; I can tell you he won&rsquo;t like it one bit when I
reappear at the College Meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bursar and I shall have plenty of time for an
explanation&mdash;later,&rdquo; said Pluto.</p>

77</span>THE DIFFICULTIES OF MR. BULL <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a></h2>
<p>I have been a good deal distressed lately by the reverses of
my friend John Bull, who is one of the leading tradesmen in this
town.&nbsp; Everybody knows his establishment.&nbsp; It does a
very large business indeed: you can get practically everything
there&mdash;coals, Lee-Metford rifles, chocolate, biscuits,
steam-engines, Australian mutton, home and colonial produce of
every kind, in short.&nbsp; My old friend is tremendously proud
of his shop, which, as he says, he has made what it is by strict
honesty (and really for an enterprising tradesman he is fairly
honest) and attention to business principles.&nbsp; He has put a
deal of capital into it, and spares no expense in advertising; in
fact, he keeps a regular department for poetry, which is written
on the premises and circulated among customers and others, and
explains in the most beautiful language that the house in
Britannia Road is the place to go to for everything.&nbsp; <!--
page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>John, who prides himself on his literary taste,
considers this to be the finest poetry ever written; and Mrs.
Bull reads it out to him in the evening before he has his regular
snooze after supper.</p>
<p>Everything was going on swimmingly until this unfortunate
Hooligan trouble began.&nbsp; I must explain to you that Mr. Bull
owns a great deal more property than the actual premises where he
transacts business.&nbsp; Somehow or other, in course of time he
has become the proprietor of bits and scraps all over the town
and suburbs&mdash;tenements, waste lands, eligible building
sites, warehouses, and what not&mdash;the whole making up what,
if it was put together, would be a very considerable
estate.&nbsp; How it all came into John Bull&rsquo;s hands nobody
knows properly; indeed, I don&rsquo;t think he does
himself.&nbsp; Some of it was bought, and bought pretty dear
too.&nbsp; Some of it was left to him.&nbsp; A good deal of it
he&mdash;one doesn&rsquo;t like using the word, but
still&mdash;well, in fact, took; but, mind you, he always took
everything for its good, and for the ultimate benefit of society,
not for any selfish reasons; so that to call Mr. Bull a pirate,
as Dubois does who keeps the toy-shop over the way, is manifestly
absurd.&nbsp; Anyhow, it is a very fine property, and would be
bigger still if Jonathan C., a cousin of the family, hadn&rsquo;t
<!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>taken off a good slice which used to belong to John.</p>
<p>As I was saying, this property is a very large straggling
affair, most of it a long way off from the shop.&nbsp; Its owner
finds it very hard to look after every part; all the more so,
because this town has no regular police, and is therefore
continually troubled by gangs of roughs, who go about breaking
windows and even heads, and doing damage generally.&nbsp; They
are always giving a great deal of trouble to the Bull people; and
what makes it worse is that very often they are actually tenants
on the property, who ought to know better.&nbsp; One of these
Hooligan crowds lately made a dead set against poor John; it was
all the harder because to my personal knowledge he had shown
himself most kind and forgiving to various members of this
particular gang; and once before, when they came and broke his
windows, he refused to prosecute, and simply gave them five
shillings to drink Mrs. Bull&rsquo;s health and not do it
again.&nbsp; That is the kind of man he is, sometimes.&nbsp; In
spite of this indulgent and charitable treatment, they came the
other day and made a raid into an outlying corner of his property
and did all sorts of damage; and not content with this, they
actually squatted there on land which was no more theirs <!--
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>than it is mine (I am thankful to say), where they
insulted and even assaulted innocent passers-by, and levied
blackmail on John Bull&rsquo;s adjacent tenants, and, in short,
became the terror of the neighbourhood and a disgrace to
civilization.&nbsp; And when Mr. Bull&rsquo;s watchman (I told
you there is no regular police force, and everybody has to look
after himself), when Thomas Atkins, I say, came with orders to
turn them out, they told him to go&mdash;I hardly like to say
where&mdash;and absolutely refused to stir; quite the contrary;
they hid themselves behind rubbish-heaps and hoardings and such
like, and threw things at Thomas; and when he tried to catch
them, they ran away and hid behind more hoardings, so that when
you thought they were in one place they were always somewhere
else, and the poor watchman got so knocked about with stones and
brickbats that the next morning, when he came round to the shop
to report progress, he had a black eye, and a cut head, and a
torn coat, and a nasty bruise on one of his legs.&nbsp; Mrs. Bull
had to patch up his coat and give him some arnica and
vaseline.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Atkins!&nbsp; He is a most respectable man, and an
excellent watchman, as was his father before him.&nbsp; It is a
tradition of the Atkins family that they are as brave as lions,
and do not know what <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>fear is; but unfortunately they are
not always very clever, and Thomas is a little slow at learning,
and does not pick up new tricks readily.&nbsp; His father had a
tremendous hammer-and-tongs battle with the Dubois&rsquo;
watchman once, right in the middle of the public
street&mdash;thirty-six rounds or so they had of it&mdash;and
licked him, as John Bull says, in true British style; and that is
always Thomas&rsquo;s way, and the only thing that he understands
properly; none of your underhand dodges like hiding behind places
and throwing brickbats when one isn&rsquo;t looking.&nbsp; So
that the Hooligan ways of fighting were quite too much for him at
first.&nbsp; And although Mr. Bull spent a lot of money in buying
him a new watchman&rsquo;s rattle and a very expensive
second-hand truncheon, nearly as good as the best kind, still it
was all no good, and Thomas couldn&rsquo;t turn the invaders
out.</p>
<p>All this time you must not suppose that Mr. Bull&rsquo;s
neighbours had nothing to say about the matter.&nbsp; On the
contrary, they were very much interested and, I am sorry to say,
pleased.&nbsp; Dubois the Frenchman, and M&uuml;ller, the man who
keeps the World&rsquo;s Cheap Emporium, and Alexis Ivanovitch,
the big cornfactor in the next street who is always maltreating
his workmen, were never tired of saying <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>nasty things
about Mr. Bull and crowing over the mishaps of Mr. Atkins.&nbsp;
Everybody knows what a terrible quarrel there was some years ago
between M&uuml;ller and Dubois, and how M&uuml;ller went into the
toyshop and thrashed the Frenchman then and there, so that poor
Dubois had to go to bed for a week, and for a long time
afterwards used to go about vowing vengeance.&nbsp; But this
didn&rsquo;t in the least prevent the two from fraternizing on
the common ground of enmity to John Bull.&nbsp; They would
meet&mdash;by accident, of course&mdash;just under his windows,
and then M&uuml;ller would say, very loud, to Dubois, &ldquo;Is
it not ridiculous, my friend, that this once apparently so mighty
Herr Bull and his watchman should again by the Hooliganish crowd
have been defeated?&rdquo;&nbsp; Or perhaps, &ldquo;This is what
comes of your big businesses and your straggling premises with no
one to protect them.&nbsp; How much better to have a small
compact business (though it&rsquo;s not so small either, mind
you) like my Emporium, by a large number of properly trained
watchmen defended!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Dubois would say,&mdash;so
that it annoyed the Bull household very much
indeed,&mdash;&ldquo;Behold the fruits of being a pirate and a
robber.&nbsp; Conspuez M. Atkins!&nbsp; Justice for ever!&nbsp;
&Agrave; bas les Juifs!&rdquo; (he always says that now when he
is angry&mdash;<!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>goodness only knows why).&nbsp;
Indeed Dubois got so excited that he actually thought of breaking
John&rsquo;s windows, though on reflection he decided that he
wouldn&rsquo;t do it just yet.&nbsp; And John was very cross with
Atkins and the shopboy, and even with Mrs. Bull and his son J.
Wellington Bull, and caused it to be generally known that he
would knock Dubois&rsquo;s head off for sixpence if he got the
chance.&nbsp; Then Paddy Gilhooly, who is a tenant of the
Bulls&rsquo;, in Hibernia Road&mdash;and a shocking bad tenant,
too, who never pays any rent when he can help it, and keeps his
premises in a disgraceful condition, with a lot of pigs and
poultry running about in the front parlour&mdash;this Paddy must
needs put his finger in the pie and turn against his own
landlord, so that whenever Mr. Atkins came along Hibernia Road
Paddy would put his head out of window and shout,
&ldquo;Hooligans for iver!&nbsp; More power to th&rsquo;
inimy!&nbsp; Crunchy aboo!&rdquo; and other similar observations,
of which no one took the least notice, because it was the way
with the Gilhooly family.&nbsp; Still, it was very ungrateful of
Paddy, after all John&rsquo;s kindness to him; besides being
painful to Mr. Atkins, who is a near cousin of the Gilhoolys and
would not wish to be disgraced by the conduct of his
relations.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why it is, but somehow or
other Mr. <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Bull has not the gift of making
himself generally popular.&nbsp; Time after time he has lent
Paddy money; and as for M&uuml;ller and Dubois, if they want good
advice on the proper conduct of their business, they know where
to come for it: but they don&rsquo;t seem to appreciate the
privilege.&nbsp; In short, if it wasn&rsquo;t for that little
bankrupt wine merchant Themistocles Papageorgios, whom John saved
some time ago from the consequences of litigation with a Turkish
firm, I doubt if my poor friend has one sincere wellwisher among
all the townsmen.</p>
<p>However, I am glad to say that most of them have begun to
change their tune lately, thanks to Mr. Bull&rsquo;s luck being
on the mend.&nbsp; Thomas Atkins did not make a very good start,
certainly; but as time went on he learnt a number of new tricks,
and the violent exercise which he had to take put him into
excellent training.&nbsp; Moreover, some cousins of the Bulls
showed a very proper family spirit, and sent the eldest son,
Larry, to help Mr. Atkins.&nbsp; So, what with Thomas being, so
to speak, a new man, and Larry being very strong and active, and
the shopboy coming out to lend a hand when required, the three
between them began to turn the tables.&nbsp; They caught two or
three of the marauders at last, and had them locked up; and I
sincerely hope and trust that <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>they will do
the same with all the rest very soon.&nbsp; This seems to have
produced a great change in the sentiments of Mr. Bull&rsquo;s
fellow-citizens.&nbsp; M&uuml;ller is not nearly so contemptuous
as he used to be about Atkins; and Dubois, I suppose, has
remembered that he is going to have a big summer sale this year,
and that it would be very embarrassing, under the circumstances,
to be embroiled with an influential person like this brave M.
Bull, as he calls him now.&nbsp; Only Ivanovitch is still very
sulky and goes on using violent expressions.&nbsp; I am afraid
there will be trouble yet between my poor friend and the
cornfactor&mdash;though goodness knows the town ought to be big
enough to hold both of them.&nbsp; But the fact is they have both
got mortgages on a china shop in the suburbs which is in a bad
way financially, and it makes them as jealous of each other as
possible.</p>
<p>Evidently this Hooligan affair is not going to last for ever;
and, on the whole, if things don&rsquo;t get worse, Bull may
congratulate himself on having done pretty well so far.&nbsp; But
it has hit him rather hard.&nbsp; What with buying things for Mr.
Atkins and paying him for working overtime, and having had to put
up new fire-proof shutters, and sending out the shopboy away from
his duties to help Atkins and Larry, he has lost a deal of money,
one way and <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>another; and besides, as he is very
much afraid of this kind of thing happening again, it looks as if
the whole business of the shop were going to be put on a
different footing.&nbsp; For here is J. Wellington Bull, who was
to have helped behind the counter, going out now to do
watchman&rsquo;s duty with the others; and as likely as not the
old man himself will have to take to patrolling his property
instead of looking after his customers; so that, in all
probability, there will be no one but Mrs. B. to see after the
shop.&nbsp; And, as John said to me the other day, these are no
times for leaving a business to be managed by old women.</p>
<p>He says he has seen enough of that kind of thing.</p>

87</span>THE NATION IN ARMS</h2>
<p class="poetry">This is the tale that is told of an almost
universally respected Minister,<br />
Who, being fully aware of the views of Continental Potentates,
and their plans ambitious and sinister,<br />
For the better defence of his native land, and to free her from
continual warlike alarms,<br />
Determined that he would popularize the conception (and a very
good one too) of a Nation in Arms!<br />
Now this is the way he proceeded to fan the flame of patriot
ardour&mdash;<br />
(This metre looks at first as easy to write as blank verse, or
Walt Whitman, but is in reality considerably harder),&mdash;<br
/>
He assured his crowded audience that, while everyone must
deprecate a horrid, militant, Jingoist attitude,<br />
Not to serve one&rsquo;s country&mdash;at least on Saturday
afternoons&mdash;was the very blackest ingratitude:<br />
<!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>Death on the battlefield,&mdash;or at least the expense
of buying a uniform,&mdash;was the patriots&rsquo; chiefest
glory;<br />
Dulce et decorum est (said the statesman, amid thunderous cheers)
pro patria mori!<br />
Everyone should be ready to defend his hearth and home, be it
humble cot or family mansion,<br />
Provided always that he discouraged a tendency to Militarism and
Imperial Expansion:<br />
That was the habit of mind which a Briton&rsquo;s primary duty to
stifle was,<br />
Seeing that the country&rsquo;s salvation lay rather with the
intelligent, spontaneous, disinterested volunteer who
didn&rsquo;t care how obsolete the pattern of his rifle was:<br
/>
Too much skill in shooting or drill was a perilous thing, and he
did not mean to acquire it,<br />
For fear of alarming peace-loving Emperors and such-like by
display of a combative spirit;<br />
Regular armies tended to that: and in view of the state of
international conditions he<br />
Meant to cut down our own to the minimum consistent with
Guaranteed Efficiency,&mdash;<br />
Being convinced as he was that an army recruited and trained on a
properly peaceful principle<br />
Would be wholly (and here comes a rhyme that <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>won&rsquo;t
please the mere purist, but I&rsquo;m sorry to say it&rsquo;s the
only available one) wholly, I say, and completely invincible!<br
/>
This being so, he did not propose to devise any scheme or with
cut-and-dried details to fetter a<br />
Patriot Public which quite understood of itself that England
Expects&mdash;et cetera.<br />
After this oratorical burst, as the country next day was informed
by about two hundred reporters,<br />
The Right Honourable Gentleman resumed his seat amid loud and
continuous applause, having spoken for two hours and three
quarters.<br />
The Public at once declared with unanimity so remarkable that
nothing would well surpass it<br />
That patriotic self-sacrifice was a Priceless National Asset:<br
/>
No rational person, they said, could fail to be deeply impressed
by the charms<br />
Of that truly august conception, a Nation in Arms:<br />
To become expert in the use of strictly defensive weapons, spear
or sword, Lee-Metford, torpedo, or sabre,<br />
Was a duty&mdash;if not for oneself, yet incumbent without any
shadow of doubt on one&rsquo;s neighbour;<br />
Still there were some who might possibly urge that <!-- page
90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>the
world was at peace, and the time was not ripe yet for it,&mdash;
<br />
Besides the undoubted fact that a patriot who was asked to
sacrifice his Saturday half-holiday might legitimately inquire
what he was likely to get for it;<br />
So on the whole while they recognized quite (what a metre this
is, to be sure!) that the Minister&rsquo;s scheme was replete
with attraction,<br />
They decided to wait for a while (what with the danger of
encouraging a spirit of Militarism and a number of other
excellent reasons) before putting his plan into action.<br />
Then the Continental Potentates&mdash;and if I venture at all to
allude to them, it is<br />
Only to show how all this Nation-in-Arms business may lead to the
most regrettable extremities:<br />
This part of my poem in short most painful and sad to a lover of
peace is,<br />
And in fact I believe I can deal with it best by a delicate use
of the figure Aposiopesis&mdash;<br />
However&mdash;the net result was that a time arrived when Consols
went down to nothing at all, caddies in thousands were thrown out
of work and professional footballers docked of their salary,<br
/>
<!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>And several League matches had to be played at a
lamentable financial loss in the absence of the usual gallery!<br
/>
Then, some time after that (it&rsquo;s really impossible to say
what happened in between) when business at last had resumed its
usual working,<br />
And the nation in general was no longer engaged in painfully
realistic man&oelig;uvres, on the Downs, between Guildford and
Dorking,&mdash;<br />
Then the public met and resolved like the person whose case is
recorded in fable<br />
That now that the steed had been stolen (or at least suffered
from exposure to the air) it was high time to close the door of
the stable;<br />
And that never again no more should their cricket-fields,
football grounds, croquet lawns, bunkers,<br />
Be profaned by the feet of Cossacks, Chasseurs, Bashi-Bazouks, or
Junkers;<br />
And I don&rsquo;t think they talked very big about Nations in
Arms, or inscribed on their banners any particularly inspiring
motto,<br />
But they learnt to shoot and to drill, not more or less but quite
well&mdash;in spite of the dangers of Militarism&mdash;for the
plain and simple reason that they&rsquo;d got to!</p>

<p class="poetry">A Novelist, whose magic art,<br />
Had plumbed (&rsquo;twas said) the human heart,<br />
Whom for the penetrative ken<br />
Wherewith he probed the souls of men<br />
The Public and the Public&rsquo;s wife<br />
Declared synonymous with Life,&mdash;<br />
Sat idle, being much perplexed<br />
What Attitude to study next,<br />
Because he would not wholly tell<br />
Which Pose was likeliest to sell.<br />
To him the Muse: &ldquo;Why seek afar<br />
For things that on the threshold are?<br />
Why thus evolve with care and pain<br />
From your imaginative brain?<br />
Put Artifice upon the shelf,&mdash;<br />
Take pen and ink, and draw&mdash;Yourself!&rdquo;<br />
The author heard: he took the hint:<br />
He photographed himself in print.<br />
His very inmost self he drew. . . .<br />
The critics said, &ldquo;<i>This</i> Will Not Do.<br />
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Which used to plumb the human heart,&mdash;<br />
This suffers from the patent vice<br />

Of Inverisimilitude:<br />
He&rsquo;s written out; his skill&rsquo;s forgot:<br />
He only writes to Boil the Pot!<br />
It is not true; it will not wash;<br />

And if he can&rsquo;t&rdquo; (they told him flat)<br />
&ldquo;Get nearer to the Life than that,<br />
He will not earn the Public&rsquo;s pelf!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">This happens when you draw Yourself.<br />

Who dreams that Man is Woman&rsquo;s equal),&mdash;<br />
She with a hand divinely free<br />

Why obscurely crawl and grovel?&mdash;I will write (I said) a
Novel!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So I started and I planned it in the ordinary

<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;d a Heroine&mdash;a creature of

I&rsquo;d a Villain&mdash;worse than Nero,&mdash;I&rsquo;d a most
superior Hero:<br />

book:</p>
<p class="poetry">Each was drawn from observation: yet was each a
pure creation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which revealed at once the genius of originating
mind:<br />
<!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Not a man and not a woman but combined the Broadly
Human<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a something quite peculiar of an interesting
kind:</p>
<p class="poetry">What a wealth of meaning inner in the things
they said at dinner!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How their conversation sparkled (like the ripples on
the deep),<br />
Half disclosing, half concealing a Profundity of Feeling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which would move the gay to laughter and incite the
grave to weep!</p>
<p class="poetry">There they stood in grace and vigour, each
imaginary figure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each a masterpiece of drawing for the world to
wonder at:<br />
There was really nothing more I had to find but just the
story,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing more, but just the story&mdash;but I
couldn&rsquo;t think of that.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet (I cried), in other writers, how the lovers
and the fighters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are conducted through the mazes of a complicated
plan,&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

the man!</p>

the stripling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till they&rsquo;re ultimately landed in the
matrimonial state,&mdash;<br />
And they die, or else they marry (in a Kipling or a Barrie)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as if the thing was ordered by unalterable
Fate,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">While with me, alas! to balance my innumerable
talents,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a fatal imperfection and a melancholy
blot:<br />
All the forms of my creating stand continually waiting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a charitable person to provide them with a

&nbsp;&nbsp; A battle &rsquo;gainst effete Tradition!<br />
When Movements moved, with holy zest<br />

And was among the first and best<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Educational Reformers.</p>
<p class="poetry">He saw the Boy at Public Schools<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Regard his books with fear and loathing,<br />
From Latin&rsquo;s arbitrary rules<br />

Pastors and masters, one and all,<br />

No pedagogues with idle noise<br />

Released from books and teachers both,<br />

And, if they lose in mental growth,<br />

class="pagenum">p. 139</span>THE HEROIC AGE</h2>
<p class="poetry">When I ponder o&rsquo;er the pages of the old
romantic ages, ere the world grew cold and gray,<br />
When there wasn&rsquo;t a relation between Oxford and the Nation,
or a Movement every day,<br />
How I marvel at the glamour (in these duller days and tamer)
which informed those scenes of glee,<br />
At the glamour and the glory of contemporary story, and the
Eights as they used to be!</p>
<p class="poetry">It is obvious that the weather must have
differed altogether from the kind that now we know:<br />
I arise from reading Fiction with the permanent conviction that
it did not hail, nor snow:<br />
For each fair and youthful charmer had a summer sun to warm her
and a bran new frock and hat,&mdash;<br />
In the progress of the lustres, when the crowd of Fashion musters
it has grown too wise for that.</p>
<p class="poetry">Every boat from keel to rigger was a grand
ideal figure as it skimmed those Wavelets Blue,<br />
While the Heroes who propelled &rsquo;em were comparatively
seldom of a commonplace type, like you&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>In their strength and in their science they were
positively giants, through the gorgeous days of old,<br />
Still an Admirable Crichton in those <i>lieben alten Zeiten</i>
was the oarsman brave and bold:</p>
<p class="poetry">He could row devoid of training, and (it hardly
needs explaining) got a quite unique degree:<br />
With his blushing honours laden, he espoused a lovely maiden at
the end of Volume Three:<br />
This alone he had to grieve for&mdash;that he&rsquo;d nothing
more to live for, or expect from Fortune&rsquo;s whim:<br />
For I never could discover, when his Oxford days were over, what
the world could hold for him!</p>
<p class="poetry">O the rapture singlehearted of that Period has
departed, with its views ornate of Man,<br />
And I think it won&rsquo;t come back till we restore the
Pterodactyl, or revive the late Queen Anne:<br />
We have grown in mental stature, and we Go Direct to Nature, in
these days of stress and strife,<br />
And the hero of a novel in a palace or a hovel is intolerably
True to Life:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Not an infant learns to toddle but <span
class="smcap">efficiency&rsquo;s</span> his model, which he still
pursues with rage,<br />
In a manner inconsistent with the methods dim and distant of that
mid-Victorian age:<br />
<!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Fashion&rsquo;s glass and mould of form,<br />
How in shape and how in features<br />
Far surpassing other creatures,<br />
How incomparable to<br />

He in whose transcendent state<br />
All the ages culminate&mdash;<br />
Could we ever keep him thus,<br />
How delightful &rsquo;twere for us!<br />
Could he, &rsquo;mid the admiring throng,<br />
Ever beauteous, ever young,<br />

Wear that aureole still which now<br />

<span class="smcap">He</span> must sink to middle age<br />
(E&rsquo;en the Poet&rsquo;s soaring wit<br />
Scarcely can envisage it):<br />
Go with men of common clay<br />
In to business every day:<br />
Be perhaps a Brewer, or<br />
Haply a Solicitor,&mdash;<br />
None the fact to notice that<br />
Haloes once adorned his hat:<br />
Ay! the ways of Fate are odd:<br />
Men are mortal . . .&nbsp; Ichabod . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">* * * * *</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet shall stay by stream and tree<br />
Something still of what was He,&mdash;<br />
Plainly put, his More or Less<br />
Immaterial Consciousness,&mdash;<br />
Very fine and very large,<br />
Floating o&rsquo;er his College barge:<br />
Always while the world continues<br />
Bards shall sing his thews and sinews,&mdash;<br />
Here he rowed and here he ran,<br />
Being rather more than man;&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>Thus as ages onward go<br />
Still he&rsquo;ll great and greater grow,<br />
Larger still in prose or rhyme<br />
Looming down the aisles of time,<br />
Till he sit, sublime and vast,<br />
&rsquo;Mid the Giants of the Past,<br />
Men who lived in days of old<br />
(Ch-tty, W- -dg-te, N-ck-lls, G-ld),<br />
Lived and rowed in ages dark<br />
Long ere Noah built the Ark,<br />
Very, very famous oars,<br />
Mighty men in Eights and Fours,<br />
Towering o&rsquo;er our Browns and Smiths<br />
Huge and grey, like Monoliths.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Hero&rsquo;s happy
fate<br />
Keeps in store a blissful state,<br />
All adown the Future dim,<br />
Nearly worthy e&rsquo;en of Him!</p>

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
